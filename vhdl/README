The "wbtc.exe" binary in Xilinx ISE WebPACK 13.1 appears to crash during the build process for some
reason. I think this is just the WebTalk thing that sends information about your design to Xilinx,
so it's safe to replace with something innocuous (and functional):

  cd %XILINX%\bin\nt\unwrapped
  mv wbtc.exe wbtc.exe.old
  printf "#include <stdio.h>\nvoid main() { printf(\"wbtc.exe was called\\n\"); }\n" > wbtc.c
  cl wbtc.c

You can do it on Linux too if you like:

  cd ${XILINX}/bin/lin/unwrapped
  mv wbtc wbtc.old
  printf "#include <stdio.h>\nvoid main() { printf(\"wbtc.exe was called\\\n\"); }\n" > wbtc.c
  gcc -o wbtc wbtc.c
